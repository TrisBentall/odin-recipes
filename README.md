# Odin Recipes

This my project from The Odin Project, Fundamentals Course

This simple HTML site will let me demonstrate what I have learnt so far, including:

- Setting up the basic html boilerplate
- Creating heading and paragraphs
- Using stong and em elements to emphesise text
- Creating absolute and relative links
- Adding images to a site, remembering to include relavent alt text
