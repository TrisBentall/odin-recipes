    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>For the Stir Fry:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>450g extra firm tofu</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>200g sugar snap peas</li>
        <li>4 medium bell peppers</li>
        <li>240g chestnut mushrooms</li>
        <li>200g baby corn</li>
        <li>1/2 cup spring onions</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the Stir Fry Sauce:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Press the tofu for 30 minutes. It's ideal if you have a tofu press, but if you don't then place the tofu onto a plate with another plate on top and then place something heavy on top of that like a heavy pot. Let it press for 30 minutes to get rid of as much water as possible.</li>
        <li>While the tofu is pressing prepare your veggies and mix up your stir fry sauce by adding all the sauce ingredients to a measuring jug and whisking together until mixed.</li>
        <li>When the tofu has finished pressing, cut it into cubes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of sesame oil to a wok and heat it on medium heat. When it's hot add the tofu cubes and fry them until the tofu is golden brown. Then remove the tofu from the wok.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to the wok and add chopped sugar snap peas, bell peppers, mushrooms and baby corn and stir fry for a few minutes until the veggies are soft but still firm.</li>
        <li>Add tofu and chopped spring onions and pour over the sauce. Stir fry for a couple of minutes until the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and chopped spring onions.</li>
    </ol>
